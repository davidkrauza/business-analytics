#Unit 5: Data Exploration
In this unit we will begin exploring datasets using descriptive statistics and data visualization tools

##Learning Objectives
After completing the readings and reviewing the unit materials the student will be able to:
* Define data exploration
* Explain the role of descriptive statistics in data exploration
* Understand how to use data visualizations for data exploration

##Unit Materials

##Discussion Topic
Write a post, not exceeding 150 words, describing why an analyst would start an analysis project by generating descriptive statistics and/or developing data visualizations?

Please cite any articles you reference in your post

##Assignment
As a team look at the dataset you are using for the course:
* Develop descriptive statistics on some aspect of your data set
  * The descriptive statistics should be able to inform a decision maker
  * See the IPython notebook for this unit for an example
  * *Using Excel is also acceptable*
* Develop a visualization of some aspect of your data
  * As with the descriptive statistics, the visualization should be informative
  * Please see the IPython notebook for this unit for an example
  * *Using Excel is also acceptable*
* Create and publish a written brief. A sample written brief can be found [here] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CnEhffB6UuuQEHhVvJ3pewhsSCKuc7aDV_WgJzSU9jU/edit?usp=sharing)
* Commit your work to your github account

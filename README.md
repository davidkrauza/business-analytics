#Business Analytics
##Description
Data analytics is the process of generating and delivering information that enables and supports an improved and timely descision process. The aim of this course is to provide the student with an understanding of how to design data "experiements", structure data for analysis, and use a broad range of decision analysis techniques to analyze real-world business problems. Students will use data analysis technique to help decision makers arrive at a decision. Topics covered include:
1. Foundations of Business Analytics
2. Data Exploration
3. Cleaning Data
4. Predictive Analytics
5. Developing Data Driven Delveriables

##Goal
The goal of this course is to develop an understanding of the process of analyzing data using key techniques and technology. This course will focus on the principles of data management, data exploration, data visualizations, drawing inferences from data, and developing effective means of communicating inferences to decision makers. Students will use industry standard tools such as:
1. SQL
2. Microsoft Excel
3. Google Sheets
4. Python.
Finally, the students will gain practical experience analyzing real world datasets.

##Course Structure
Collaboration with others is very important on data analysis project. Students in this course will form teams of 2 or 3 and will complete all assignments in their teams. The students will leverage online collaboration tools such as:
1. [Google G Suite] (https://gsuite.google.com/)
2. [Slack] (https://slack.com/)
3. [Skype] (https://www.skype.com/en/)
4. [Trello] (https://trello.com/) or [Asana] (https://asana.com/).
Students in their teams will be required to meeting fortnightly with the instructor online to review the progress and direction of the team project.

##Course Project
Using a real world dataset the student will work in teams to complete a data analytics project. This will include sourcing a real world dataset, determining the key intelligence questions to be answered, drawing conclusions from the data, preparing deliverables for decision maker, and briefing the decision maker.

##Course Tools
Students will need to utilize the following tools in the course:
* Microsoft Excel
* Anaconda IPython Notebook
  * The notebook can be downloaded from: <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>
  * Be sure to download and install version 3.5 or greater
* Kaggle.com account
  * Register for a free account here: <https://www.kaggle.com/account/register>
  * This is a great source of publicly available datasets for use on the term project
* Mode Analytics account
  * Register for a free account here: <https://modeanalytics.com/signup>
  * It's recommended that you use your school '.edu' email address to register
  * This will be used for our SQL assignments
* GitHub account
  * Register for a free account here: <https://github.com/join?source=header-home>
  * This will be used to share Excel, Python, and data files
  * Please keep in mind that a free account is open to the public, so do not load any senstive information to you account

##Course Outline
Unit | Description | Learning Objectives
--- | --- | ---
 1 | Introduction | In this unit we will provide a definition of analytics, provide examples of how ananalytics are used, and form our teams for the term
 2 | Overview of data analytic tools | In this unit we'll review our toolkit for data analytics, including Excel, Python, Mode Analytics, and GitHub
 3 | Selecting datasets and data | This unit covers the principles of database management and querying databases using SQL. Students will also select the dataset they will use for the term
 4 | Principles of tidy data | In this unit we will focus on how to prepared and structure our datasets so that it is easy to manipulate, model, and visualize the data
 5 | Data exploration | We will begin exploring datasets using descriptive statistics and data visualization tools
 6 | Analytic techniques | We will review major analytic techniques such as clustering and regression analysis. We will also discuss how to determine which analytic techniques and models should be used to answer our intelligence question
 7 | Designing data experiments | Using the dataset for the term project we will determine our Key Intelligence Questions, discuss the scientific method, and develop reproducible research
 8 | Drawing conclusions from data | This unit will help us answer the question "What do the results from the analytic techniques tell us?"
 9 | Developing deliverables | Here we will develop effective deliverables to communicate the "so what?" to our decision maker - which should help reduce uncertainty in their decision making process
 10 | Final Briefing | Brief the instructor on your term project

#Unit 2: Overview of data analytic tools
In this unit we'll review our toolkit for data analytics, including Excel, Python, Mode Analytics, and GitHub. A quick search of data analytics positions on LinkedIn.com indicates that knowledge of these tools are in demand for data analytic professionals.

##Learning Objectives
After completing the readings and reviewing the unit materials the student will be able to:
* Discuss various data analytic tool stacks
* Identify the appropriate tool for a given analytic need
  * Situations where Excel is the preferred tool
  * Situations where a programming language (e.g. Python) is the preferred tool
  * Key differences between tools (e.g. appropriate mindset)
* Use basic git commands
  * Basic command line operations
  * Use of GitHub.com
* Log into Mode Analytics

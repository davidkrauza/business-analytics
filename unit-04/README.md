#Unit 4: Principles of tidy data
In this unit we will focus on how to structure our datasets so that it is easy to manipulate, model, and visualize the data

##Learning Objectives
After completing the readings and reviewing the unit materials the student will be able to:
* Summarize the characteristics of tidy data
* Identify the causes/sources of messy data
* Use techniques and tools to cleanup messy data

##Unit Materials
###Lecture Slides
* [Unit 04 - tidy data] (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JeA_eBGSHWJn6Udnv7Hh8xcwQRaJVfuqcVehtShoLo4/edit?usp=sharing)

###Lecture Videos

###Readings
* [Turning Messy Data into tidy data] (http://machinelearningmastery.com/data-cleaning-turn-messy-data-into-tidy-data/)
* [Cleaning up data with spreadsheets] (http://schoolofdata.org/handbook/recipes/cleaning-data-with-spreadsheets/)

##Discussion Topic
Write a post, not exceeding 150 words, describing the benefits of tidy data and the challenges an analyst faces cleaning up messy data. Also, why would a decision maker be interested in tidy data?

##Assignment
As a team look at the dataset you are using for the course. Answer the following:
* Does this dataset adhere to the principles of tidy data?
* If it does not adhere, why and what can be done to make it tidy?
* If it does adhere, why does it adhere?
* Create a written brief answering these questions. A sample written brief can be found [here] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-4MVphZnBOCPzgYAeLBi5UFNYOLta05bCPunSQpnsk4/edit?usp=sharing)

* Save your dataset to you github account a share your dataset with the instructor.
  * If your dataset is not already tidy, make it tidy before you share it on github.

#Unit 6: Analytic Techniques
In this unit we will review major analytic techniques such as clustering, community detection (network analysis), and linear regression analysis. We will also discuss how to determine which analytic techniques and models should be used to answer our intelligence question

##Learning Objectives
After completing the readings and reviewing the unit materials the student will be able to:
* Basic understanding of popular analytics techniques, including:
  * Cluster analysis
  * Community Detection (network analysis)
  * Linear regression analysis
* Leverage the Python *scikit-learn* machine learning library for analytic techniques
* Leverage the Python *networkx* library for cluster analysis

##Discussion Topic
*Completed Individually*

Write a post, not exceeding 150 words, explaining how a data would leverage cluster, community detection (network) analysis, and regression analysis together. Please provide examples of these techniques being used.

Please cite any articles you reference in your post

##Assignment
As a team look at the dataset you are using for the course:
* Utilize the techniques reviewed in this unit
* Please structure the use of the these techniques in such a way that they build off each other. In other terms do not use each technique in a vacuum
* Create and publish a written brief providing an insight (a "*so what?*"). A sample written brief can be found [here] ()
* Commit your work to your github account

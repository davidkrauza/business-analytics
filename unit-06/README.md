#Unit 6: Analytic Techniques
In this unit we will review major analytic techniques such as clustering and linear regression analysis. We will also discuss how to determine which analytic techniques and models should be used to answer our intelligence question

##Learning Objectives
After completing the readings and reviewing the unit materials the student will be able to:
* Basic understanding of popular analytics techniques, including:
  * Cluster analysis
  * Network analysis
  * Linear regression analysis
* Leverage the Python *scikit-learn* machine learning library for analytic techniques
